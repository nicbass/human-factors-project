# Drowsiness Detection

Welcome to our Drowsiness Video Detection Software. The purpose of this proejct is to help keep drivers safe and awake on the road.

Our system analyzes video through a camera (must have camera) and detects if a user is displaying signs of drowsiness. If so, it reponds by sending out an audio and haptic alarm until it detects that they are no longer showing these signs (controler and speaker not provided).
